Bug Report for Teammate's Code

Bug #1: Appt.java, isValid()
replaced the '||' in "if(startMinute<0 || startMinute>59)" with an &&.

This causes a chain reaction in the application and causes many of the other test methods and normal
functions to crash. 

The reason is because by replacing the || with an &&, no matter what value the user enters for startMinute,
it's never going to be invalid, because it's impossible for a number to be both less than 0 and greater
than 59.

Bug #2: TimeTable.java, getApptOccurences()
in the line "for(int i = 0; i < appt.getRecurNumber()+1; i++)", removed the +1.

This causes the getApptoccurences method to always miss the last occurence for any appointment.

The reason is because of how recurrence for an appointment is defined in the Appt class, requiring this
method to increment the recur number by one to get all of the possible recurrences for an appointment.

Bug #3: Appt.java, compareTo()
In the line "return startMinute+startHour+day+month+year", replaced the + between startMinute and
startHour with a -.

This causes a faulty compareTo value when comparing two different appointments in Calday or in TimeTable,
which also leads to a sort of chain reaction where other parts of the code fail because they rely heavily
on this method working properly.

The reason is becasue this can give faulty values about if an appointment is before or after another appointment.
Combined with the failure of the isValid() method to properly detect value startMinutes, the effects are 
in a way amplified.
